Hi all,
Imay have a solution to this Xquartz and VMD issue. It is indeed an issue
with XQuartz. I believe it has something to do with allowing XQuartz to
allow indirect GLX contexts. (What that specifically means I don't know. My
expertise here is lacking but that's what I can find being discussed
online.) But the following fixes my implementation.
The fix is this: Quit XQuartz, then in the macOS Terminal application (on
your own machine, *not* logged into the reomte cluster) run:

    defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true

Reload your terminal and you should then be able to log into a remote
cluster and launch run remote XQuartz sessions for VMD
